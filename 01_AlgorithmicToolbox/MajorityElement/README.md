### Problem Introduction

Majority rule is a decision rule that selects the alternative which has a majority,
that is, more than half the votes.
Given a sequence of elements *𝑎<sub>1</sub>*, *𝑎<sub>2</sub>*, . . . , *𝑎<sub>𝑛</sub>*, you would like to check whether
it contains an element that appears more than *𝑛*/2 times. A naive way to do
this is the following.

    MajorityElement(𝑎<sub>1</sub>, 𝑎<sub>2</sub>, . . . , 𝑎<sub>𝑛</sub>):
    for 𝑖 from 1 to 𝑛:
        currentElement ← 𝑎<sub>𝑖</sub>
        count ← 0
        for 𝑗 from 1 to 𝑛:
            if 𝑎<sub>𝑗</sub> = currentElement:
                count ← count + 1
        if count > 𝑛/2:
            return 𝑎<sub>𝑖</sub>
    return “no majority element”

The running time of this algorithm is quadratic. Your goal is to use the divide-and-conquer technique to
design an 𝑂(*𝑛* log *𝑛*) algorithm.

### Problem Description

**Task.** The goal in this code problem is to check whether an input sequence contains a majority element.

**Input Format.** The first line contains an integer *𝑛*, the next one contains a sequence of 𝑛 non-negative
integers *𝑎<sub>0</sub>*, *𝑎<sub>1</sub>*, . . . , *𝑎<sub>𝑛−1</sub>*.

**Constraints.** 1 ≤ *𝑛* ≤ 10<sup>5</sup>; 0 ≤ *𝑎<sub>𝑖</sub>* ≤ 10<sup>9</sup> for all 0 ≤ *𝑖* < *𝑛*.

**Output Format.** Output 1 if the sequence contains an element that appears strictly more than 𝑛/2 times,
and 0 otherwise.

**Time Limits.**
